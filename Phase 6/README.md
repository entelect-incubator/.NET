### **Events**

The [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) package introduced in Phase 2 provides the capability of firing off events between different commands and is introduced in Step 2. This prevents duplicate code from being created and adheres to SOLID principles. [Hangfire](https://www.hangfire.io) is introduced in Step 3 to schedule background jobs.
