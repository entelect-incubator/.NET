## What is it?

.NET is a powerful, versatile developer platform that enables the creation of a wide range of applications. It is a free, cross-platform, open-source framework that can be used to build web, mobile, desktop, gaming, and IoT applications. One of the best ways to get started with .NET is through the .NET Incubator, which is designed to provide hands-on experience and real-world application development skills to aspiring developers. This training course covers the essential concepts of .NET programming, including C# language syntax, debugging techniques, and the use of .NET Core libraries. With the .NET Incubator training course, you can become proficient in creating high-quality, scalable applications using the .NET platform.

## Why should I learn about it?

### Cross-platform support

.NET is a cross-platform framework, which means that developers can build applications for Windows, Linux, and macOS using the same codebase. This allows developers to target a wider range of platforms and reach a larger audience with their applications.

### Large community and ecosystem

.NET has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are plenty of resources, tools, and libraries available for developers to use. This also means that developers can get help and support from the community when they run into problems or have questions.

### Performance and scalability

.NET is designed to be fast and efficient, which makes it ideal for building high-performance applications. It also provides scalability features such as load balancing, which can help applications handle large amounts of traffic.

### Easy to learn and use

.NET is a relatively easy framework to learn and use, especially for developers who are already familiar with object-oriented programming languages such as Java or C++. The syntax is straightforward, and there are plenty of tutorials and resources available to help developers get started.

### Versatility

.NET can be used to build a wide range of applications, including web applications, desktop applications, mobile applications, games, and IoT applications. This makes it a versatile framework that can be used for almost any type of project.

Overall, developers love .NET because it is a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use framework that allows them to build high-quality applications for a wide range of platforms and use cases.

# Pezza Digital Solutions

In this section, we will start building projects to allow Pezza to manage their pizzas and allow customers to order their favourite pizza online.

## Intro

Restaurant staff should be able to manage their different pizzas through a web application. Customers should be able to order a pizza online, this order should be visible to their restaurant. The customer should also be notified that their pizza is on its way. We will start solving these business requirements by doing the following:

- [ ] Expose your Pizza Management through an API using .NET Web API that will be consumed by the front-end application. It will consist of a customer and a pizza entity.
- [ ] Create a simple ordering system in .NET MVC to allow customers to order pizzas.
- [ ] Allow for customer notifications to be sent out via email.

    C -->|DB| E[Pezza DB - SQL];
```

## Learning Outcomes

### Phase 1 - Getting started

We will be starting with how to make a basic project and refactoring it into a solution following the single responsibility principle and how to set up a basic clean code architecture / layered architecture. This setup format will be used throughout the incubator.

Overview

### Phase 2 - Scaffolding

We will be extending the foundation from Phase 1 to all Entities CRUD operations, we will also be moving to use CQRS Pattern and Mediatr NuGet Package.

### Phase 3 - Data Validation and Data Pagination

Now that we have deployed phase 2, we can make a few enhancements. Also, it will be easier for the customer and admin to search and filter through the data, so we will add that in as well.

Overview

- [ ] Fluent Validation
- [ ] Filtering
- [ ] Searching
- [ ] Pagination
- [ ] Entity Framework Core
  - [ ] Migrations
  - [ ] Change Tracker API
  - [ ] Lazy Loading, Eager Loading, Explicit Loading
  - [ ] TPH, TPC, TPT

### Phase 4 - Coding Standards and Error Handling

 When we work as part of a team, we usually need to adhere to coding standards. Let's have a look at how we can enforce some of the most basic standards and adding error handling.
  
Overview
- [ ] [Error Handling](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/5fcd4c8a-4e7b-41ac-9836-d1366da97c82?channelId=fe5bc582-9acb-4952-9b71-b29aab0bc9e9)

### Phase 5 - Performance Improvement

To improve performance we introduce caching and compression. Caching is useful in scenarios where we retrieve data that does not change very often. Response compression usually increases the responsiveness of an app in cases where the client supports it.
Overview
- [ ] [Performance and Memory Management](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/64098be8-6979-4c10-85f4-efa91d0cb1f1?channelId=fe5bc582-9acb-4952-9b71-b29aab0bc9e9)

### Phase 6 - Events

We would like to notify the customer as soon as his order has been completed and ready for collection.

Increasing Performance

- [ ] Domain Events
- [ ] Simple Email Notification
- [ ] Schedule Background Jobs
  - [ ] Hangfire

### Phase 7 - Microservices

- [ ] [Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-nswag?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio)

An API client is a set of tools and protocols that operate from an application on a computer. They help you to bypass some operations when developing a web application rather than reinventing the wheel every time. Using a client API is a great way to speed up the development process.
