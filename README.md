# E List Solution

In this section, we will begin developing projects to manage the new E List Solution.

## Intro

The Entelectuals family, known for their focus on organization and efficiency, has launched a comprehensive training initiative alongside their venture into the digital world. This program is open to all family members who wish to contribute to the success of the familyâ€™s new project.

In the field of software engineering, a solid grasp of fundamental principles is crucial. To that end, the training program covers a wide range of topics, from core concepts to advanced techniques. It is designed to address real-world challenges faced by developers and to provide strategies for overcoming recurring issues, while promoting best practices across all teams.

To address the business requirements, we will begin by implementing the following:

-   [ ] Expose your TODO items through a .NET Web API, which will be consumed by the front-end application. This API will manage a "tasks" entity.
-   [ ] Create a simple front-end system using .NET MVC to allow users to manage their TODO list.
-   [ ] Enable email notifications when a task is overdue.

```

## Learning Outcomes

### Phase 1 - Getting started

We will be starting with how to make a basic project and refactoring it into a solution following the single responsibility principle and how to set up a basic clean code architecture / layered architecture. This setup format will be used throughout the incubator.

Overview

### Phase 2 - Scaffolding

In Phase 2, we will expand the foundational system to support operations for all entities. To improve scalability and maintainability, we will adopt the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern. Additionally, we will integrate the MediatR NuGet Package to simplify and decouple command and query responsibilities, allowing for better separation of concerns and more efficient processing across the system.

### Phase 4 - Coding Standards and Error Handling

In Phase 4, we will focus on ensuring code quality by enforcing basic coding standards across the team. Adhering to these standards helps maintain consistency, readability, and long-term maintainability. Additionally, we will implement robust error handling throughout the system to improve reliability and make debugging easier.

Overview

### Phase 5 - Performance Improvement

In Phase 5, we will enhance system performance by introducing caching and response compression. Caching will be implemented for scenarios where data retrieval involves content that does not change frequently, reducing redundant operations and improving load times. Additionally, response compression will be added to increase app responsiveness by reducing the size of data transferred between the server and clients that support it.

-   [ ] [Performance and Memory Management](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/64098be8-6979-4c10-85f4-efa91d0cb1f1?channelId=fe5bc582-9acb-4952-9b71-b29aab0bc9e9)

### Phase 6 - Events

In Phase 6, we will implement an email notification system to alert users when they are late in completing a task on their TODO list. This feature ensures that users are promptly informed about overdue tasks, helping them stay on top of their responsibilities.

Increasing Performance

-   [ ] Domain Events
-   [ ] Simple Email Notification
-   [ ] Schedule Background Jobs
    -   [ ] Hangfire

### Phase 7 - Microservices

-   [ ] [Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-nswag?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio)

In Phase 7, we will integrate an API client, a set of tools and protocols that help streamline the development of web applications. By using an API client, we can avoid reinventing the wheel for common operations, significantly speeding up the development process and improving efficiency.

-   [ ] Intro
-   [ ] API Client

### Phase 8 - User Interface

In Phase 8, we will develop a simple website using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. This site will interact with the API built in the previous phases to manage TODO items. By leveraging MVC, we can separate concerns effectively, providing a clean structure for the application while allowing users to interact with their tasks seamlessly.

Overview

-   [ ] [MVC Part 1](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/61e64cfa-c3ba-45c3-9811-e5bc25968a2a?channelId=fe5bc582-9acb-4952-9b71-b29aab0bc9e9)

### Phase 9 - Security Coming Soon

With improved performance and a growing customer base, itâ€™s crucial to secure the website to protect sensitive data and ensure user privacy. In Phase 9, we will implement key security measures, such as data encryption, secure authentication, and protection against common vulnerabilities, ensuring the system is robust and safeguarded against potential threats.

Overview

-   [ ] [Security](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/2a2b5226-34cb-49ac-b8fe-880cb9ac893c?channelId=fe5bc582-9acb-4952-9b71-b29aab0bc9e9)
