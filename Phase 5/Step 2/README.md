## **Compression**

To improve the response time we will be adding compression. There is a variety of other things you can do to improve performance, this is just one of them.

Open up Startup.cs in API.

Add the following to the ConfigureServices method.

```cs
services.AddResponseCompression(options =>
{
    options.Providers.Add<BrotliCompressionProvider>();
    options.Providers.Add<GzipCompressionProvider>();
});
services.AddResponseCompression();
```

Add the following to the Configure method.

```cs
app.UseResponseCompression();
```

Brotli compression is used by default if it is supported by the client. If Brotli is not supported, Gzip can be used if the client supports it.

You can read more on response compression [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/response-compression?view=aspnetcore-5.0).
